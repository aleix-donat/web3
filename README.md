This is a basic Web3 crypto wallet named "Aleixwallet." 

It's just a simple webpage that you or anyone else can access to create their own crypto wallet without having to code. 

If you visit the page and press a button labeled "Generate Wallet," it shows you three important things: a public address (like an account number), a private key (like a secret code), and a seed phrase (like a backup key). All this on your laptop without needing to be connected to the internet in order to build the wallet, so it is easy and secure to start exploring the world of cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum. We built it out of two files: one for the page (index.html) and one for the instructions (index.js), with a library called ethers.js that does the heavy lifting and is free to use. It's best for beginners who want to know about wallets in blockchain.
